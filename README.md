# Implementation of a DEX following the Curve AMM
- Ganache test network
-  Build and deploy two ERC20 tokens
- Build a coin swap protocol, with two liquidity pools following two different market
- making strategies:
  - Constant Product Automated Market Making (AMM)
  - Curve-like AMM
- Liquidity pools (LPs) should provide:
  - swap() function to swap two tokens
  - ability to add liquidity into the pool, in exchange for newly minted LP tokens
  - Exchange fees proportional to popularity of the tokens! More fees for LP providers
- Build a web3 interface that connects to the userâ€™s wallet (in Javascript)
  - Let user choose LP
  - Select coins to swap
  - See current (estimated) exchange rate based on blockchain status
  - Enter amount to exchange
  - Perform the exchange
